    <p class="txt" id="txt2">Today I focus on full-stack WebAplications. From the user clicking on the website to handling the websiteâ€™s database.</p>
    <p class="txt" id="txt3">On my journey, I have learned a lot. I have met and worked on several languages including Python, Java, C++, and Rust until I began making websites and fell in love with PHP and React.</p>
    <p class="txt" id="txt4">For me, coding is much more than typing letters that are transmitted to ones and zeroes. I feel like coding has helped me a lot in my life and made me develop as a person. </p>
